## How to run it
  - Clone or download this repository
  - Inside the top-level directory of this repository, navigate into `src` and type:

## Modify Parameters
Currently, the program has some hardcoded parameters (job times and time slices) but they can be updated manually using a text editor. An improvement will be turning those into program parameters, allowing the user run the program with different values without changing the code.
